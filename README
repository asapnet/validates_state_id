ValidatesStateId
================

Installation
------------

1. go to your application's 'vendor/plugins' directory
2. git clone github.com:asapnet/validates_state_id.git

Optionally, you might want to bask in the glory of a unit-tested piece of
software, simply by running 'rake test' inside the validates_state_id directory.


Usage
-----

validates_as_state_id :number, :state_field => :us_states

# Number: id number
# state_field : state to be validation against.


Current ToDo's
--------------

- Test don't pass outside Rails project.
- Check to see if validates_format_of is a better choice.
